    title: "About me"
    excerpt: "<p>Hi there! My name is Maryn Sanders (she/her), and I'm a Ph.D. candidate working with Josh Roering at the University of Oregon. I am currently studying how climate change is changing the frequency and magnitude of shallow landslides and debris flows in two regions: (1) Western Oregon, where fires are becoming more intense and frequent, and (2) Southeast Alaska, where rain events are becoming more intense and frequent.</p> <p>I received my undergraduate degree in Geophysics from the University of California, Berkeley, where my passion for hillslope geomorphology initiated during my undergraduate research project with Bill Dietrich on rainfall-induced shallow landslide failure thresholds at a field site in the Northern California Coast Range.</p> <p>After graduating, I worked as a research assistant for the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, where I collected data on vadose zone groundwater dynamics and soil moisture stable isotopes.</p>"

    excerpt: "The Eagle Creek Fire burned 50,000 acres in the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area, Oregon, USA, in September 2017. Of the regions this fire affected, it burned 10 catchments near Dodson, OR that are highly susceptible to destructive debris flows. Using high resolution aerial lidar, I mapped debris flow fans, catchments, streams, and post-fire debris flow events to constrain erosion rates and tease out the effects of fire in an already debris-flow-prone region."

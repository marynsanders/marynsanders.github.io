    title: "About me"
    excerpt: "Hi there! My name is Maryn Sanders (she/her), and I'm a PhD candidate working with Josh Roering at the Univeristy of Oregon. I am currently studying processes related to shallow landslides and debris flows that occur following wildfire in Western Oregon, and I am very interested in how springflow and snowmelt impact geomorphic initiation thresholds. I received my undergraduate degree in Geophysics from the University of California, Berkeley, where my passion for hillslope geomorphology initiated. I had the opportunity to conduct an undergraduate research project with Bill Dietrich on rainfall-induced shallow landslide failure thresholds at a field site in the Northern California Coast Range. After graduating, I worked as a research assistant for the Eel River Critical Zone Observatory, where I collected data on vadose zone groundwater dynamics and soil moisture stable isotopes. The experience working within a critical zone project instilled within me the importance of integrating natural sciences."

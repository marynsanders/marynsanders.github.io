    excerpt: 'Hi there! My name is Maryn Sanders, and I'm a PhD candidate working with Josh Roering at the Univeristy of Oregon. I am currently studying processes related to shallow landslides and debris flows in post-fire environments of Western Oregon, and I am very interested in how springflow and snowmelt impact geomorphic initiation thresholds. My passion for hillslope geomorphology stemmed from my undergraduate research project advised by Bill Dietrich on rainfall-induced shallow landsliding thresholds at a field site in the Northern California Coast Range. After getting my Geophysics B.A. from UC Berkeley, I started as a research assistant for the Eel River CZO, where I collected data on groundwater dynamics and soil moisture stable isotopes. Working within a critical zone project instilled within me the importance of integrating natural sciences.'

My name is maryn and I am a geomorphologist.

### Landscape response to disturbance

I am using debris flow fans in the Columbia River Gorge to quantify post-wildfire erosion 

### Snowmelt and springflow influence on debris flow generation

How to quantify the effects of the two in reaching failure thresholds

### Spatially heterogeneous root strength 

Using lidR, an R package to map canopy area, I can map roots through a landscape and find zones of low root density, assume low root strength, and map where landslides are most susceptible.
